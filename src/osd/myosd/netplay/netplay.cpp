   MAME4droid Netplay Architecture (Lock-Step + Rollback)

/* ==========================================================================
 * MAME4droid Netplay Architecture (Lock-Step + Rollback)
 * ==========================================================================
 *
 * OVERVIEW:
 * Custom UDP-based netplay with two selectable execution models, chosen per
 * session (handle->mode) and defined in netplay.h (NETPLAY_MODE_LOCKSTEP /
 * NETPLAY_MODE_ROLLBACK). MAME emulation is entirely deterministic: two
 * peers stay in sync as long as they execute the exact same inputs on the
 * exact same frames from the exact same starting state. Both modes exist to
 * trade that guarantee against latency in different ways; ROLLBACK can also
 * fall back to LOCK-STEP automatically for drivers it cannot support safely
 * (see ROLLBACK FALLBACKS below).
 *
 * ── LOCK-STEP MODE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The emulator cannot simulate frame N until it has received the peer's
 * input for frame N; if it hasn't arrived, the emulation thread blocks.
 *
 * JITTER BUFFER & INPUT LAG (FRAMESKIP):
 * To hide network latency and prevent constant blocking, the system uses a
 * predefined Input Lag, internally called `frame_skip` (or `target_delay`).
 * If the delay is 4 frames:
 *   - At frame 100, we sample the local joystick.
 *   - We send this input to the peer, tagged for execution at frame 104.
 *   - The emulator then executes frame 100 (using inputs sampled at frame 96).
 * As long as the network latency is lower than the time it takes to render
 * 4 frames (~66ms), the inputs arrive ahead of time, and the game never
 * stutters. Cost: every action is felt N frames later, always. Works with
 * ANY driver (no re-simulation, no dependency on deterministic replay) --
 * the universal, always-safe mode.
 *
 * ── ROLLBACK MODE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The emulator never blocks. Each frame it predicts the peer's input
 * (repeat last known), executes immediately with local + predicted input,
 * and captures the resulting machine state into a ring buffer of savestates
 * (myosd_netplay.cpp). When the peer's REAL input for a past frame finally
 * arrives and differs from the prediction, that frame is mispredicted: the
 * machine rolls back to the last correct ring-buffer slot and fast-forwards
 * back to the present, re-simulating every frame in between with the
 * now-correct input (deferred load at a clean scheduler boundary --
 * myosd_netplay_service_deferred_load). Correct predictions cost nothing; a
 * misprediction costs a fast, silent re-simulation instead of a network
 * stall, so a good connection feels input-lag-free. The trade-off is that
 * the driver's frame re-simulation must be bit-exact deterministic.
 *
 * Rollback determinism relies on the boot itself being pinned identical on
 * both peers (RTC epoch, sample rate, CHD diff wipe, nvram/cfg) rather than
 * on transferring the initial machine state over the wire: by default
 * (NETPLAY_ROLLBACK_INITIAL_STATE_TRANSFER=0, GGPO-style) only inputs cross
 * the network and both machines simulate the identical boot locally; a
 * local save is still taken at boot -- never transferred -- purely to size
 * the ring buffer (see ROLLBACK FALLBACKS). Session-time drift accumulated
 * by re-simulation cost is corrected by a Dynamic Rate Controller that
 * nudges the machine speed factor in small per-mille steps
 * (myosd_netplay_set_speed / video.cpp's throttle baseline rescale, so a
 * step costs nothing even under continuous stepping).
 *
 * ROLLBACK FALLBACKS (drivers that cannot re-simulate bit-exact):
 * - State-size gate: the boot-time local save sizes the per-slot state; if
 *   it exceeds ROLLBACK_STATE_SIZE_LIMIT, or the adaptive ring depth
 *   (min(ROLLBACK_MAX_FRAMES, RAM budget / state size)) would fall below
 *   ROLLBACK_MIN_FRAMES, the session falls back to LOCK-STEP.
 * - Cross-device layout probe: peers exchange their state size at boot
 *   (NETPLAY_MSG_STATE_SIZE); a mismatch (e.g. a sample-rate-dependent
 *   sound-chip layout) also falls back to LOCK-STEP rather than risk a
 *   silent desync.
 * - Mid-game RESYNC (NETPLAY_MSG_RESYNC): a user-triggered recovery that
 *   re-synchronizes both peers from a freshly transferred state without
 *   restarting the session, for a driver that desyncs during play.
 * - CRC desync detector (myosd_netplay.cpp, NETPLAY_CRC_DETECTOR_ENABLED,
 *   diagnostic / off by default): periodically hashes every "memory/"
 *   save_item and compares peers, naming the exact diverging item when a
 *   driver turns out not to be rollback-safe.
 *
 * INTEGRATION WITH MAME:
 * 1. netplay_pre_frame_net():
 *    Called by the OSD layer just before MAME executes a video frame.
 *    LOCK-STEP: blocks until the peer's input for the current
 *    `target_frame` is available, then injects local + peer input.
 *    ROLLBACK: never blocks; captures state, predicts the peer's input
 *    (repeat-last), and injects local + predicted input immediately.
 *
 * 2. netplay_post_frame_net():
 *    Called immediately after MAME finishes executing the frame. Samples
 *    the new local input, prepares it for execution N frames in the future
 *    (LOCK-STEP) or transmits it right away (ROLLBACK), advances the frame
 *    counters, and sends the UDP packet to the peer. Also runs the
 *    Auto-Frameskip evaluation (LOCK-STEP) every 5 seconds.
 *
 * RESILIENCE (both modes):
 * - N-1 History: Every UDP packet contains the inputs for both the current
 *   frame and the previous frame. If a single packet is lost, the next
 *   packet transparently recovers the lost data, preventing emulation
 *   stalls.
 * - Auto-Frameskip (LOCK-STEP): Automatically adjusts the input lag
 *   (Jitter Buffer) based on real-time network conditions, finding the
 *   optimal sweet spot between smoothness and responsiveness.
 * - Build/protocol handshake: peers exchange a protocol version and the
 *   rollback limits (state-size cap, ring depth, RAM budget) at JOIN, and
 *   refuse a mismatched build rather than risk an undiagnosable desync.
 *
 * FILE LAYOUT (netplay.cpp), most central first:
 *   1. Core state & ubiquitous utilities (handle accessor, byte-order codec)
 *   2. Per-frame game-thread trunk (netplay_pre/post_frame_net)
 *   3. Network receive path (netplay_read_data)
 *   4. Network send path (protocol senders, netplay_send_data)
 *   5. Session lifecycle (init/mode/warnings/resync trigger/game-start
 *      bootstrap: netplay_track_connection/initial_sync/start_barrier)
 *   6. External predicates / UI hooks
