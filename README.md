**MAME4droid (Current)** is an Android port of the **MAME 0.289** emulator. Developed by **David Valdeita (Seleuco)**, this project aims to provide a highly optimized, native Android experience for arcade and classic computer emulation. It supports over 40,000 ROMs and introduces several custom features and architectural improvements specifically tailored for modern mobile hardware.

## ✨ Notable Features

Beyond the standard MAME core, this version includes several native implementations designed to improve multiplayer, performance, and visual accuracy on Android devices.

### 🌐 Native NetPlay (Rollback & Lockstep)
Built from scratch as a native part of the app, allowing you to play over Wi-Fi or mobile data without relying on third-party accounts, lobbies, or relay servers.
* **Dual Sync Modes:** Features deterministic **Rollback** for near-zero input lag (ideal for fighting games and fast action) and **Lockstep** for games where rollback isn't feasible.
* **Smart Desync Recovery:** A real-time CRC detector warns you if the session drifts. A 1-tap "Resync" option recovers the game on the fly without having to disconnect. Network-aware frameskip and adaptive input delay handle latency spikes automatically.
* **Direct Connections (IPv6 / CGNAT Bypass):** Full IPv6 support allows direct peer-to-peer connections even over mobile networks (4G/5G) where traditional IPv4 NAT fails.
* **Zero Router Setup:** Includes a custom STUN client, automatic UPnP port mapping, and UDP hole punching. 
* **Easy Invites:** Tap 'Share' to send your connection details via any messaging app. The app automatically parses the IP address when the other player pastes the text.

### ⚡ Performance & Android Integration
Designed to run demanding titles smoothly on mobile hardware:
* **ADPF & Frame Pacing:** Integrated Android Dynamic Performance Framework (ADPF) to manage thermal states and CPU/GPU scaling dynamically, paired with accurate frame pacing for a smoother experience.
* **arm64 DRC (Dynamic Recompiler):** Includes a dedicated 64-bit ARMv8 recompiler, providing a significant performance boost for heavy 90s 2D and 3D hardware (e.g., CPS-3, Killer Instinct).
* **SAF Persistent Cache:** A concurrent persistent cache with lazy loading heavily improves boot times, specifically when reading large ROM sets via Android's Scoped Storage.

### 📺 Graphics & Visuals
A rebuilt GLES graphics pipeline focused on display accuracy:
* **Physical CRT Vector Simulation:** A custom, pure GPU-based vector rendering engine that physically simulates optical bloom and phosphor persistence for classic vector monitors.
* **HDR Rendering:** True FP16 HDR rendering path to utilize peak panel brightness on modern OLED/AMOLED displays, including SDR-to-HDR highlight expansion (Inverse Tone Mapping) for raster games.
* **Typography & Shaders:** Crisp native system font rendering for the OSD, combined with customizable CRT overlay filters, scanlines, and advanced shader support.

## 🛠️ Recommended Setup (External Storage)

To save internal space and ensure fast boot times, it is highly recommended to store your ROMs on external storage using Android's **Scoped Storage** system.

### First-Time Installation
1. **Prepare your storage**: Create a folder named `MAME4droid` (or any name you prefer) on your SD card or internal memory.
2. **Initial Launch**: Open the app for the first time.
3. **Path Selection**: When asked for your ROMs location, select **EXTERNAL STORAGE**.
4. **Grant Permission**: The Android file picker will open. Navigate to your created folder, tap **"Use this folder"**, and allow access.
5. **Romset Version**: Ensure you are using the **0.289 romset** for proper compatibility.

*Note: You can change the path anytime in **Options > Settings > General > Change ROMs path**.*

## 🎮 Controls & UI
* **Gamepads:** Plug-and-play support for Bluetooth/USB gamepads with analog support.
* **Touch & Sensors:** Customizable on-screen button layouts (1 to 6 buttons), touch lightgun support, autorotation, and tilt-sensor support.
* **Haptics:** Fine-tuned, smarter haptic feedback for UI and gameplay.
* **i18n:** Fully internationalized interface.

---

## ⚠️ Important Disclaimers

* **No ROMs Included**: MAME4droid is strictly an EMULATOR and DOES NOT INCLUDE ROMS or copyrighted material.
* **Hardware Requirements**: Despite optimizations, MAME is a demanding emulator. Late-90s 3D arcade games require a high-end Android device to run at full speed.
* **Not Affiliated with MAMEDev**: This port is an independent project and is not officially supported by the mainline MAMEDev team.
* **Support**: Due to the massive library of supported titles, I cannot provide support for specific individual games.
